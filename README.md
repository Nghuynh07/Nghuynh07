I am a full-stack developer with a strong interest in front-end development. I started my programming journey March, 2021. I enrolled and graduated as a full-stack developer in Java (Spring boot), Python (Django), and MERN stack. I am very lucky to have found my passion in programming in my early 30s. I often struggle as a self-taught / bootcamp programmer; however, I have come a long way from zero knowledge to full-stack developer. Currently looking for opportunity in software development ultilizing 10 years experience in healthcare profession (pharmacy) and BA degree in Visual Art.
